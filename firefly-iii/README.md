Firefly-III - A free and open source personal finance manager

## About

Fork of [hassio-addons/addon-firefly-iii][hassio-firefly] project
in hope of continuing to maintain this add-on.

"Firefly III" is a self-hosted financial manager. It can help you keep track of
expenses, income, budgets and everything in between. It supports credit cards,
shared household accounts and savings accounts. Itâ€™s pretty fancy. You should
use it to save and organise money.

Further information can be found at [Firefly-III].
